# Mini games in Unity

![Beispielbild](Recordings/Image Sequence_001_0005.jpg)

Hey there. This Repo will show you 13 well-known mini-games I've programmed.
Some of them are visually still rustic as my main goal was to implement the core mechanic of each game.

Each game has either a Pause Menu, accessible via esc, or a Game Over/Won Panel that occurs after the game ends.

## How to play: 

**Astroids**
- Shoot = space bar
- Movement = w,a,s,d
