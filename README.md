# Mini games in Unity

Hey there. This Repository will showcase 13 well-known mini-games that I've programmed in Unity.
Some of them are still visually rustic, as my main goal was to implement the core mechanics of each game.

It is meant as an exercise for game developer students (beginner/entry level), as such games are often seen in exams. Try to rebuild these games from scratch in Unity and use this repo as a reference when you get stuck.

It will teach you:
- basic game algorithms
- data structures
- Coroutines
- basic game math
- Canvas & Prefabs
- MonoBehaviour methods



Each game has a Pause Menu, accessible via Esc, or a Game Over/Won Panel that appears after the game ends.

## How to play: 

**Astroids**
